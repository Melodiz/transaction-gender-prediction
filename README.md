# Gender Prediction Model

This repository contains the groundwork for a machine learning model designed to predict the gender of a client based on their transaction history. The data used for training the model was provided by Sber during one of their hackathons.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the gender of a client using their transaction data. The repository includes:

- **Data Preparation and Analysis**: Initial exploration and preprocessing of the transaction data.
- **Model Tuning**: Code for tuning the model's hyperparameters can be found in `model/Tuning.ipynb`.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Detailed rules and metrics for evaluating the model's performance are documented in `data/gender_project.ipynb`.

## Current Status

The solution is currently under development and the model has not been fully implemented yet. The notebooks provided contain the initial steps and methodologies planned for the project.
